This API has a very simple frontend, where you can request your simulations and
see all the available results, as well as some pretty plots of each simulation.

Right now we are not serving online, but plan to do so some day. If you want to
run the frontend and API locally in your machine please go to the section
:ref:`Install and run PHYS Simulation <start-install>`.
